# BlueConduit Working Group Research Networks - External Publications

### Purpose

It is the goal of the BlueConduit Experimental Working Group to explore research related to the communities with whom we cocreate in order to establish and reward ethical data science and engineering practices.


The choice to include papers is below is not a complete reflection of the interest, scope, or depth of the fields addressed by BlueConduit peers. This is a living staging area for the Working Group.
It is the hope of the writer that a more dynamic research cache will be developed in the near future.
