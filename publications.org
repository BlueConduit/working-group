#+TITLE: BlueConduit Working Group Research Networks

* Purpose

It is the goal of the BlueConduit Experimental Working Group to explore research

BlueConduit nurtures curiosity and research within the team. 
Work linked here need not be directly related to current BC work. 
It is the goal of the reading group to identify and experiment with emerging ML science, and this will serve as a launch-site to that end.
The choice to include papers is based purely on the user-experience of this writer, and is not a reflection of the scope or depth of the fields discussed in the papers below.
It is the hope that a more dynamic research model will be developed in the coming week.
